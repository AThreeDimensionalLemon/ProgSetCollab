Define a class called mySet.  In each have an array that can store 20 integers.

         Have isEmpty(), isFull(), insert( int inX) , delete( int inX), printAll(),

         and these two set operations --- mySet Union(mySet inS) -- and --- mySet Intersection(mySet inS) ---functions

         and any other function or variable necessary...

 Declare two Set Classes, A and B, and load them with the following values:

         A( 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19), and B ( 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,  9, 12, 14, 16, 18 )

Perform the Union() on set A with B, then printAll( ) - write the result to Set C.

Perform the Intersect() set A with B, the printAll( ) - write the result to Set D.
